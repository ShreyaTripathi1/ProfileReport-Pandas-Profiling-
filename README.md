# Data Analysis Demonstration with Pandas Profiling

https://shreyatripathi1.github.io/ProfileReport-Pandas-Profiling-/

This project is a demonstration of the powerful data analysis tool **Pandas Profiling**, applied to a dataframe. The goal is to showcase how easily you can create a detailed report from a DataFrame in Python using just a few lines of code.

## Overview

Pandas Profiling generates a comprehensive analysis report, which includes:

- Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features
- Correlation matrix and interactions between features
- Detection of missing values and potential data quality issues
- Visual insights into the distribution of data, outliers, and duplicates

The provided report allows users to gain meaningful insights from their data quickly and effortlessly.

## Features

- **Interactive Report**: The report generated is interactive and visually appealing, making data exploration easy.
- **Automated Analysis**: Automates the process of generating EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) reports, reducing the need for writing extensive code.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the report to include or exclude certain sections based on your requirements.
